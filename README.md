<!-- ☝️ replace this description with a description of your own work -->
## This project
This is a project that uses the reddit API. This API gets data from reddit and puts it into my project.

<!-- replace the code in the /docs folder with your own, so you can showcase your work with GitHub Pages 🌍 -->

<!-- Add a nice poster image here at the end of the week, showing off your shiny frontend 📸 -->

## Data
A lot of data gets sent through the reddit API.

### Drawbacks
The reddit API is huge, and sends you lost of information about everything that has relation to the origional post. This means that every comment, and all userdata is sent via the API. Because of this it's difficult to get the correct data into the application. Another drawback is loading speed. The objects are big, and take some time to load, especially with multiple posts. Same goes for image sizes, feched images from these posts are big file sizes and take some time to load.

<!-- Maybe a checklist of done stuff and stuff still on your wishlist? ✅ -->

<!-- How about a license here? 📜 (or is it a licence?) 🤷 -->
