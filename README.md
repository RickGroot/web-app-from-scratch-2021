## Data
A lot of data gets sent through the reddit API. In this application subreddits get defined and called. Reddit sends back a random post from the requested subreddit. Data gets modified and modulated, only correct data gets rendered to the page. Data gets checked via it's url type and amount of likes. Once the data is fetched and checked, it will append to the HTML page, where you can be inspired by a random picture gallery.

### JSON example
Data below is some data of an image. This is just a small section of all image data that gets passed to the application trough the reddit API.    

This is some data manipulation to get to the correct data:
```js
let post = data[0].data.children[0].data;
```
    
And this is a section of the JSON data from 'post':
```json
{
    "hide_score": false,
    "id": "ljfawo",
    "link_flair_css_class": null,
    "link_flair_richtext": [],

```

### API Drawbacks
The reddit API is huge, and sends you lost of information about everything that has relation to the origional post. This means that every comment, and all userdata is sent via the API. Because of this it's difficult to get the correct data into the application. Another drawback is loading speed. The objects are big, and take some time to load, especially with multiple posts. Same goes for image sizes, feched images from these posts are big file sizes and take some time to load.

## Somewhere in the future
- [ ] Add images to favorites
- [ ] More filter options
- [ ] Improve routing
